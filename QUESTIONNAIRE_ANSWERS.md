### If you have a user requirement to create a new page what are the steps you take to create the solution focusing on (UI,UX, FE)

I would take a structured approach to ensure the requirement gets completed succesfully. By following these steps, I would reduce uncertainty, understand the requirements and guarantee the end result aligns with the stakeholders expectations.

1. Gather and understand the requirements (target audience, stakeholders requirements, clarify any questions, determine key features, etc)
2. Research and plan for the project execution (Search and analyze similar products if any, identify potential technical risks and opportunities, clarify the scope and time for the project, etc)
3. Wireframing and design (Develop early designs and prootype to showcase functionality and look to discuss with stakeholders, showcase initial versions of the visual design, including layout, typography, color scheme, etc; Conduct user testing and compile feedback to refine the visual and user experience aspect of the product)
4. Development (Once the project requirements has been defined and prototyped, start development for the back and/or front of the application, taking into the account all items specified in previous steps and effectively documenting the code)
5. Testing and user acceptance (Once the product is available to start testing the different pieces, the idea will be to execute the test and then iterate over it in case of issues or needed performance improvements)
6. Launch (Finally once the project is completed , tested and accepted by stakeholders, proceed with the deployment and posterior monitoring and analisys of performance)

### Do you have experience using state management libraries? Can you explain how you used it?

Yes, I have worked working with various state managment libraries, particulary in React, where I have worked with Context API, Redux and most recently, Zustand. In a previous work, I worked with Redux, making use of the centralized store (to hold the state data), actions (to describe the changes that will happen) and reducers (to manage the state updates) to manage the complex application state used by the webpage of a travel company.

### What are some of the code best practices you use in your experience?

-   Meaninful naming
-   Reusability
-   Clear comments
-   Consistent formatting to help readability and maintainability
-   Clean code (DRY, SRP, KISS, YAGNI)
-   Good error handling
-   Logging
-   Testing, testing and testing

### What are some ways to style components? Can you provide an explanation of each?

-   Inline styling (style applied directly to the element)
    `<button style={{backgroundColor: "red"}}>Submit</button>`
-   CSS stylesheets (styles written in a css file and applied to the elements)
    `Create a styles.css file with a .button class selector`
    `Import the file and use the selector in the HTML we want to format`
-   CSS Frameworks
    `(Utility-first like tailwindcss or libraries like Bootstrap, materialUI, SemanticUI, etc)`

### Describe 3 ways to pass information from a component to its parent component

-   Callbacks (Parent component passes a function as props to child component, child component uses the function to pass data back and then parent component receives the data and updates the state or executes actions)
-   Context API (Parent component provides a global state or function via context, and child components access and updates state through it without the need of passing props)
-   Using state management libraries (Redux, Zustand, etc)

### Do you have experience in design systems? Can you please share your experience and best practices?

Yes, I have experience in system design, most recently in Monolithic and microservices architectures. In my last job, the core of the company was implemented in a monolith developed using RoR and I also developed multiple microservices using RoR and node.js. As best practices, I would suggest keeping these into account

-   Scalability (Design the software to allow scale as traffic and usage increments)
-   Maintainability (Software should be easy to understand, modify, and extend over time)
-   Performance (Software should aim for optimal performance and responsiveness)
-   Security (Software should keep data secure and prevent any unwanted access or data manipulation)
-   Reliability (Software should be able to withstand failures or issues and be able to recover and keep working)
